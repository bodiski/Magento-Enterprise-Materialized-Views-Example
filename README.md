## Introduction

This repository is an example Magento extension that uses the new Mview component in Enterprise Edition 1.13.  It was built as part of a blog post at http://www.eschrade.com/page/indexing-in-magento-or-the-wonderful-world-of-materialized-views/

## Installation

To install this extension simply copy it into your base Magento installation directory since it starts with the /app directory standard for Magento core files.  The configuration file is located in /app/etc/modules and is turned on by default so copying the files (and flushing the cache) is all you should need to do to install it.
