# Introduction

This repository is an example Magento extension that uses the new Mview component in Enterprise Edition 1.13.  It was built as part of an expert article done by Magento's ECG (Expert Consulting Group) showing how people can use the Mview component to create their own managed Materialized Views in Magento.

# Installation

To install this extension simply copy it into your base Magento installation directory since it starts with the /app directory standard for Magento core files.  The configuration file is located in /app/etc/modules and is turned on by default so copying the files (and flushing the cache) is all you should need to do to install it.
